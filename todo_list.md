================
There is still much to be done with this project. Post things that need to be done here and hopefully we will find the time to work on them!

-Fix bug when playtowin function crashes after 5 or more loops

-Add logic that determines the best move based on 'outs' or the probability of drawing a moveable card

-Find out the probability of winning a game, average number of games played before winning, other statistics

-Optimize code for speed

-Find out how long it takes for the program to play a game
